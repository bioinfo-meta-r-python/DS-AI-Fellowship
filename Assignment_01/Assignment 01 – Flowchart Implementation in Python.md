\## 🖥️ **Implemented Flowcharts**



1\. \*\*Flowchart 01\*\* → Height check (Can ride or not)  

2\. \*\*Flowchart 02\*\* → Height + Age (basic ticket price)  

3\. \*\*Flowchart 03\*\* → Height + Age + Photo option (with total bill)  

4\. \*\*Flowchart 04\*\* → Height + Age + Special discount (ages 45–55) + Photo option

\## **📝 Notes / Fixes**



\- Used a \*\*`**bill` variable**\*\* in Flowchart 3 \& 4 to properly calculate the \*\*total bill\*\*.  

\- **Reordered conditions** in Flowchart 4 so the \*\*45–55 age discount\*\* is applied correctly.
